# MiniProject-
# The code starts by importing essential libraries like pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, numerical operations, and machine learning tasks. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and its correlation matrix is visualized to understand feature relationships. Features (joint angles) and target variables (end-effector positions) are defined, and the data is split into training and testing sets. A Random Forest Regressor is trained on the training data, and predictions are made on the test set. Evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RÂ² are calculated and compared to a baseline model. Predicted vs. actual values are visualized using scatter plots, and residuals are plotted for further performance assessment. Finally, feature importances are extracted from the model and visualized to highlight the most influential features in predicting the end-effector positions.
